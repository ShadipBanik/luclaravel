 University Forum:

‘university Forum’ is a web-based communication tool (or activity) that enables participants to post messages and to reply to others' messages asynchronously. The online discussion typically lasts longer and gives students time to think about what they are going to contribute. They enable users of a website to interact with each other by exchanging tips and discussing hot topics related to any academic subject or events.
